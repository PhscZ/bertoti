> "We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play.   On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."

  In the modern era - the internet and the software avaiable on it - are extremely bloated and poorly designed more often than not, while it might not be the case for the biggest websites from IT companies, it surely often is for smaller companies and government websites, the reason for this is due to the accessibility and ease of programming in the modern era, with free or paid but highly popular (due to propaganda) courses and tutorials which are often made by those that lack technical knowledge about SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.
  
  This happens in multiple ways, both the performance often due to poor programming skills and bad choices; such as the programming language used, people often naturally seek out the easiest way to do something but that way might not always be the best way, this and the lack of critical thinking before starting a project caused the web to be extremely bloated - that is, code being slow, too big, and often full of not necessary features - while a few years ago, due to the lack of computational software of the time, and how programmers had to be effective in order to deal with that, and also the fact programming was less popular and often programmers were more educated, very often in formal ways.
  
  And the issue is not even using easy to learn and apply languages such as Python, or even not the language at all but what the programmer chooses to do with the language, but how it relates to the scope of the project, if you are going to have millions of users, then maybe performance will not only be a great tradeoff for ease of development for you (due to, for example, using less server-power) but also for the user.

  If you look at Google Lighthouse statistics, you can see that most web users have extremely slow computers and most often mobile devices in the modern era, and the loading time for websites is insanely long, the same applies to typical desktop software considering the huge amount of frameworks and premade content used: when calculating the value of pi with the Leibniz method 100000000 times, C is 176.2 times faster than stanard Python, which was made with C as it's programming language!
  
  There is also the fact that things come and go, years ago Adobe Flash was the hot thing, while now browsers do not even support it, and it was the high-level easy-to-learn easy-to-use language of the time, and it died exactly due to this: performance, security and compatibility issues. 
  
  I constantly experience all of this which I've mentioned myself with software I am often forced to use, because after all a lot of people are not aware of better alternatives out there, but with time and new good software with good marketing and advertisement behind them, naturally things should get better, as they did from the Flash days, but you might just have some great opportunities coming up being aware of all of this!
